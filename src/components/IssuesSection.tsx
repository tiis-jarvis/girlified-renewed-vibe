Period poverty affects an estimated 500 million girls and women worldwide. And this is more acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, where we come from. In Nigeria, for example, 37% of menstruators cannot afford menstrual products, and, in many cases, this means that they cannot go to school or carry out their daily activities.",
